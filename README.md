## Course Design
  ### ‚≠ê Implementation of bilateral filtering
Bilateral filtering is a type of nonlinear filtering that can achieve the effect of denoising and edge preservation. Compared to Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering has an additional mask, which also considers grayscale similarity. Therefore, bilateral filtering is a compromise processing that combines the spatial proximity and pixel value similarity of the image. This course design replicates this processing.
