## Course Design
  ### ⭐ Implementation of bilateral filtering
Bilateral filtering is a type of nonlinear filtering that can achieve the effect of denoising and edge preservation. Compared to Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering has an additional mask, which also considers grayscale similarity. Therefore, bilateral filtering is a compromise processing that combines the spatial proximity and pixel value similarity of the image. This course design replicates this processing.

#### 🚢 Specific principles
The kernel of the filter is generated by **two functions**:
**Space distance**: refers to the Euclidean distance between a point in the neighborhood and the center point.
**Grayscale distance**: refers to the absolute value of the difference between the grayscale of a certain point in the neighborhood and the grayscale of the center point.

Compared to Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering adds weights to grayscale information, meaning that within the neighborhood, points with grayscale values closer to the center point have greater weights, while points with larger grayscale differences have smaller weights. So the final weight size of the mask is determined jointly by the spatial domain Gaussian kernel function and the value domain Gaussian kernel function.

Point p is the center of the mask (circled in yellow), and point q is a point in the neighborhood (circled in white). Two kernel functions are generated, one in the spatial domain and the other in the value domain, which are then multiplied to obtain the final kernel function. The input is convolved or correlated to obtain the output. From the graph, it can be seen that the edges are well preserved and noise is also suppressed.

#### 🚀Experimental results and conclusions

<p align="center"><img src="image/bilateral filtering_image2.jpg" width="650px"/>

The experimental results show that bilateral filters can effectively preserve image edge details while filtering out low-frequency noise components. For simple filtering, two sigma values can be set to the same value. If the value is less than 10, the impact on the filter is minimal. If the value is greater than 100, it will have a significant impact on the filter, making the image appear cartoonish.

### ⭐ Implementation of Simple Chat Software Based on TCP Protocol
#### 😎 Experimental Principles
Concurrent connection server oriented algorithms
Connection oriented servers achieve concurrency between multiple connections (not between requests).The main algorithms of the program are as follows:

    1. master thread：Create a socket and bind it to a well-known port of the provided service, keeping the socket connection oriented.
    2. master thread: Set the port to passive mode.
    3. master thread: Repeatedly calling accept to receive the next connection request from the client and creating a new slave thread or process to handle the response.
    4. slave thread: The connection request passed by the master thread begins.
    5. slave thread: Use this connection to interact with customers; Read request and send back response.
    6. slave thread: Close connection and exit.
    
The structure of Concurrent server process:
    1. The server includes a master process and zero or more slave processes. One thread per process.
    2. The main server uses accept to block calls, saving CPU resources. When a connection arrives, accept returns immediately.

#### ⚔️ Project Implementation Steps and Operations
  Compile program
 `$gcc -o chatclient chatclient.c
  $gcc -o chatserver chatserver.c`

  Enable the server to select port 734 and open the server to put it in a listening state
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image1.jpg" width="650px"/>
 The client first establishes a connection with the server, and the server creates sub processes representing a client in the chat room. The customer         enters their name and chats in the chat room using this ID

#### 🐟 Data and results analysis
Chat rooms can enable multiple people to log in(During testing, the service displayed the same login IP as the three IP addresses because they were logged in from the same IP address）
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image3.jpg" width="650px"/>

There is a shared storage space between the client and server, which enables the content sent by users to the server to be displayed on all clients
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image4.jpg" width="650px"/>

For example, here **usr1** sends a "hello_ World", all clients display the source and time of message sending.The server also displays the source of the message.If a message is sent with multiple letters, the spacing between spaces indicates multiple strings, which will be sent multiple times. If multiple words need to be sent, they cannot be separated by spaces and can be separated by underscores.

### ⭐ Implementation of Image Retrieval System and MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
####  Implementation of Image Retrieval System
Implementing content-based image retrieval: Content based image retrieval technology retrieves images based on their own content features, eliminating the process of manually annotating images. Using a certain algorithm to extract features from images and storing them to form an image feature database. Extract the features of the image to be retrieved during retrieval, calculate the correlation between the image in the feature database and the image to be retrieved based on certain similarity criteria, and sort them in descending order to obtain the image that is most relevant to the image to be retrieved.

##### 🚢 Experimental content

2. Learning a visual dictionary
3. Use a visual dictionary to quantify the features of each image, and the center points of each cluster become the key values of the visual dictionary. Each image is represented by its frequency of similarity with these center points. The k-dimensional histogram shown in the following figure.
