## Course Design
  ### ‚≠ê Implementation of bilateral filtering
Bilateral filtering is a type of nonlinear filtering that can achieve the effect of denoising and edge preservation. Compared to Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering has an additional mask, which also considers grayscale similarity. Therefore, bilateral filtering is a compromise processing that combines the spatial proximity and pixel value similarity of the image. This course design replicates this processing.

#### üö¢ Specific principles
The kernel of the filter is generated by **two functions**:
**Space distance**: refers to the Euclidean distance between a point in the neighborhood and the center point.
**Grayscale distance**: refers to the absolute value of the difference between the grayscale of a certain point in the neighborhood and the grayscale of the center point.

Compared to Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering adds weights to grayscale information, meaning that within the neighborhood, points with grayscale values closer to the center point have greater weights, while points with larger grayscale differences have smaller weights. So the final weight size of the mask is determined jointly by the spatial domain Gaussian kernel function and the value domain Gaussian kernel function.

Point p is the center of the mask (circled in yellow), and point q is a point in the neighborhood (circled in white). Two kernel functions are generated, one in the spatial domain and the other in the value domain, which are then multiplied to obtain the final kernel function. The input is convolved or correlated to obtain the output. From the graph, it can be seen that the edges are well preserved and noise is also suppressed.

#### üöÄ Experimental results and conclusions

<p align="center"><img src="image/bilateral filtering_image2.jpg" width="650px"/>

The experimental results show that bilateral filters can effectively preserve image edge details while filtering out low-frequency noise components. For simple filtering, two sigma values can be set to the same value. If the value is less than 10, the impact on the filter is minimal. If the value is greater than 100, it will have a significant impact on the filter, making the image appear cartoonish.

### ‚≠ê Implementation of Simple Chat Software Based on TCP Protocol
#### üòé Experimental Principles
Concurrent connection server oriented algorithms
Connection oriented servers achieve concurrency between multiple connections (not between requests).The main algorithms of the program are as follows:

    1. master threadÔºöCreate a socket and bind it to a well-known port of the provided service, keeping the socket connection oriented.
    2. master thread: Set the port to passive mode.
    3. master thread: Repeatedly calling accept to receive the next connection request from the client and creating a new slave thread or process to handle the response.
    4. slave thread: The connection request passed by the master thread begins.
    5. slave thread: Use this connection to interact with customers; Read request and send back response.
    6. slave thread: Close connection and exit.
    
The structure of Concurrent server process:
    1. The server includes a master process and zero or more slave processes. One thread per process.
    2. The main server uses accept to block calls, saving CPU resources. When a connection arrives, accept returns immediately.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Project Implementation Steps and Operations
  Compile program
 `$gcc -o chatclient chatclient.c
  $gcc -o chatserver chatserver.c`

  Enable the server to select port 734 and open the server to put it in a listening state
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image1.jpg" width="650px"/>
 The client first establishes a connection with the server, and the server creates sub processes representing a client in the chat room. The customer         enters their name and chats in the chat room using this ID
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image2.jpg" width="650px"/>
  
#### üêü Data and results analysis
Chat rooms can enable multiple people to log in(During testing, the service displayed the same login IP as the three IP addresses because they were logged in from the same IP addressÔºâ
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image3.jpg" width="650px"/>

There is a shared storage space between the client and server, which enables the content sent by users to the server to be displayed on all clients
<p align="center"><img src="image/Simple Chat Software_image4.jpg" width="650px"/>

For example, here **usr1** sends a "hello_ World", all clients display the source and time of message sending.The server also displays the source of the message.If a message is sent with multiple letters, the spacing between spaces indicates multiple strings, which will be sent multiple times. If multiple words need to be sent, they cannot be separated by spaces and can be separated by underscores.

### ‚≠ê Implementation of Image Retrieval System and MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
####  Implementation of Image Retrieval System
Implementing content-based image retrieval: Content based image retrieval technology retrieves images based on their own content features, eliminating the process of manually annotating images. Using a certain algorithm to extract features from images and storing them to form an image feature database. Extract the features of the image to be retrieved during retrieval, calculate the correlation between the image in the feature database and the image to be retrieved based on certain similarity criteria, and sort them in descending order to obtain the image that is most relevant to the image to be retrieved.

##### üö¢ Experimental content

2. Learning a visual dictionary
3. Use a visual dictionary to quantify the features of each image, and the center points of each cluster become the key values of the visual dictionary. Each image is represented by its frequency of similarity with these center points. The k-dimensional histogram shown in the following figure.

##### üòé summary analysis
By adjusting the number of class centers and the number of clustering iterations, the above results were obtained. It is not difficult to summarize that as the number of class centers increases, the accuracy slightly increases, but the precision is not much, which is about 0.05~0.10. The training time increases, while the subsampling increases, the training time decreases, and the limit of reduction is about 2 minutes and 10 seconds (in the case of a class center of 10).
Overall, the Precision is too low and adjusting the parameters cannot significantly increase it, which may be an algorithm problem. Improving the Precision can be achieved by changing the algorithm.

#### ‚≠ê MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
##### ü•≥ Experimental content
Digital Recognition is the ability of a computer to receive, understand, and recognize readable numbers from paper documents, photos, or other sources. The main issue that is currently receiving attention is handwritten digit recognition, which is simplified.Single digit 0-9 recognition has been recognized as an entry-level problem in the field of computer vision.The MNIST dataset contains 60000 training set images and 10000 test set images. Each sheet in the dataset.The size of the image is fixed (28x28 pixels), and the numbers on it have been standardized and centered.The word range is from 0 to 9, with a total of 10 modes.
This experiment adopts a convolutional neural network model and uses gradient descent optimization algorithms such as Adam to minimize the loss function.

##### ü¶à Experimental results and analysis
In this experiment, the following four parameters were changed to explore their impact on the experiment, in order to select the optimal model.
** Using different batch sizes for training (batch_size)
** Different number of iterations (epoch)
** Using different optimization algorithms
** Different learning rates (learning_rate)
1. Data of control group
   
<p align="center"><img src="image/MNIST_image1.jpg" width="650px"/>
  
2. When taking different iterations(epoch)
   
<p align="center"><img src="image/MNIST_image2.jpg" width="650px"/>
  
The above figure is a line graph when the total number of epochs is 10 and 5. When epoch=10, the function clearly enters a plateau, while when epoch=5, the function does not enter a plateau and is still in an upward phase, indicating that the number of epochs entering the plateau is between 5 and 10, which is consistent with the visual observation of 7-8 epochs mentioned earlier. The optimal epoch should be greater than 10
3. Using different batch training sizes (batch_size)

<p align="center"><img src="image/MNIST_image3.jpg" width="650px"/>
We chose batch_size
4. Different learning rates (learning_rate, hereinafter referred to as lr)

<p align="center"><img src="image/MNIST_image4.jpg" width="650px"/>
  
The initial accuracy increases with the increase of learning rate, and the higher the learning rate, the faster it enters the stationary period (when lr=0.001, it takes about 6-8 rounds, while lr=0.01 is within 5 rounds). When entering the stationary period, the average accuracy decreases with the increase of lr, and as lr increases, the amplitude of fluctuations becomes larger. It is worth mentioning that when lr>0.1, accuracy will sharply decrease, with an average accuracy of around 0.11. Considering all factors, lr=0.001 is optimal.
5. Different optimizers
The control group used the Adam optimizer in this experiment. Two optimizers, Adagard and SGD, were compared with the Adam optimizer. Due to space limitations, this article will not explain each optimizer.

##### üòé Summarize
This experiment selected four parameters, namely batch size, iteration number, optimization algorithm, and learning rate, to explore the optimal model and parameters under different conditions. The experiment achieved good results. Through this experiment, we have further learned deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, deepening our understanding of deep learning.

### ‚≠ê Butterfly fly
#### ü¶à Game Introduction
This game features the INFP personality from MBTI as the protagonist, and because the official portrait features a butterfly, everyone calls her Little Butterfly. Little Butterfly is a person who frequently experiences setbacks in real life, but she has infinite imagination. In her fantasy world, she imagines the difficulties and bad people she encounters in life as obstacles and monsters. She overcomes and overcomes them in her own world, making herself mentally stronger to cope with real-life difficulties, achieve self transformation, and break free from cocoons to become a butterfly. In this game, the protagonist runs parkour in different levels, avoids obstacles, keeps moving forward, and gains more coins and points to exchange for growth resources, unlock new levels, become stronger, and ultimately become the ideal self.
#### ‚öîÔ∏è Game Settings
##### Game Scene Settings
The concept of the game scene is to depict the protagonist in a quiet and mysterious forest, constantly advancing in adventure, through elements such as background, game characters, ground, and interactive interface. In the deep blue jungle, faint stars and mist can be seen, appearing fantastical and mysterious. The characters and road surface in the center of the scene are the main parts of the game scene. The red monsters in the game create a strong contrast with the main color of the scene, enhancing the sense of danger in the game scene and providing players with a more exciting gaming experience. The game characters use light color combinations, which are more lively compared to the dark background of the jungle, while also showing a feeling of fast running. The gold coin pattern and pixel heart used in the interface display the number of coins and health points that players have obtained, making it easier for players to better understand their game achievements and health situation during the game experience.
In the game UI interface design, the butterfly element symbolizing the infp protagonist was selected, and a dark gray and transparent box was used in the pause interface, which conforms to the main tone of the game. When paused, the entire interface can be seen without causing a sense of discontinuity when players return to the game, improving the interaction experience between players and the game.

##### Store System Settings
Players can accumulate coins in the game and exchange them for other game resources after reaching a certain amount, such as unlocking new levels and maps, unlocking new characters, upgrading character attributes, purchasing items to gain bonuses, etc.

##### Other Settings
The monsters in the game symbolize various difficulties in life. In parkour levels, monsters can be divided into two types: larger monsters do not attack characters, but act as obstacles to their movements, hindering the protagonist from running forward; Smaller monsters can attack the protagonist, and if the protagonist does not dodge, their health will be deducted; The protagonist can also attack monsters by touching them with a staff, causing them to disappear.
The protagonist in the game is an adventurer who has just entered the jungle. The protagonist can attack monsters by touching them with a wand or choose to dodge. The protagonist obtains coins in parkour, exchanges them for new game resources, constantly grows stronger, and embarks on new adventures.
#### üöÄ Game Core
‚Ä¢	In a game, the character has a total of 3 HP points. If they touch a monster or fall below the boundary line, HP will be deducted. If the 3 HP points are exhausted, the game endsÔºõ
‚Ä¢	Players can control their characters to jump through the space bar, and by pressing the button twice in a row, they can jump in two segmentsÔºõ
‚Ä¢	Players can eliminate monsters by touching them with their wandsÔºõ
‚Ä¢	Players can collect coins and continuously jump forward to obtain higher scores, which can be used to exchange for other game resources for character development.
